StarX
    To extend capabilities of starUML
    As a user
    I want to create extensions for starUML.
    
Scenario?

This is not supposed to be gherkin. It's an example mapping session!

What functionality do I want?

Story 1
 - When I create class diagrams, a major source of annoyance is that I cannot bulk add methods/attributes. I have to either type each one out or copy paste one by one. I want to provide the header file code and automatically create/append to a class diagram.

 > Rules:
    - Functions must be added following the UML conventions. <visibility> [qualifier] <function name> ([param direction] <param name>: <param type> [= default value],...): <return type>
    - Function can be abstract/static. The property must be respected in diagram (ie abstract should be italic and static should be underlined).

 > Questions:
    - Header file parsing?
    - Parsing for each lang or just cpp? Probably a better idea to start with cpp and then add each lang support.
    - Maybe use yacc/lex or any existing parser.

Story 1.1
 - At the very least provide a list of methods to be bulk added.

 > Rules:
    - Functions to be added must follow UML conventions. <visibility> [qualifier] <function name> ([param direction] <param name>: <param type> [= default value],...): <return type>


Story 2
 - When I work with starUML, the default (esp in class diagrams) word wrap setting is off. When word wrap is off it doesn't allow a class to be resized beyond a limit and it gets very annoying. I'd like to be able to keep it on so that I can freely resize my classes.

 > Rules:
    - A word wrap setting default should affect whole application instance.

 > Questions:
    - How to add a session wide preference?
      Check the docs.

Story 3
 - If I mistakenly add a class instead of interface, I want to be able to change the class to interface and vice versa.

 > Rules:
    - Member details of the uml instance (class/interface) should not be changed only the uml type should be changed.
    - Project file should not be left in a corrupt state.
    
  > Questions:
     - How to modify the uml instance other than editing the .mdj xml?
       Check the docs.

Story 4
 - I want the methods of an interface to be abstract by default. If it's cpp, abstract virtual.

 > Rules:
    - Abstract methods by default for interface, should affect whole application instance.

 > Questions:
    - How to add a session wide preference for a particular uml type?

Story 4.1
 - I want to be able to select a bunch of methods and make them virtual/abstract or edit them in bulk.

 > Rules:
    - Multi-selection must be supported across classes/interfaces.
    - Changes must not affect other elements.

 > Questions:
    - How to acess selected element and add a command that takes multiple selections.

 Story 5
 - I want to be able to specify, in/out direction of parameter by the prefix i or o in parameter name.

 > Rules:
    - i for in, o for out, io for in/out.

 > Questions:
    -??

Story 6
 - I want the zoom setting and the page focus area to be specific to the page instead of specific to whole session.
